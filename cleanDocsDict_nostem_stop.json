worstcase space complexity displaystyle computer science the hopcroftkarp algorithm sometimes more accurately called the hopcroftkarpkarzanov algorithm algorithm that takes input bipartite graph and produces output maximum cardinality matching set many edges possible with the property that two edges share endpoint runs displaystyle oesqrt time the worst case where displaystyle set edges the graph displaystyle set vertices the graph and assumed that displaystyle eomega the case dense graphs the time bound becomes displaystyle and for sparse random graphs runs time log displaystyle oelog with high probability the algorithm was found john hopcroft and richard karp 1973 and independently alexander karzanov 1973 previous methods for matching such the hungarian algorithm and the work edmonds the hopcroftkarp algorithm repeatedly increases the size partial matching finding augmenting paths these paths are sequences edges the graph which alternate between edges the matching and edges out the partial matching and where the initial and final edge are not the partial matching finding augmenting path allows increment the size the partial matching simply toggling the edges the augmenting path putting the partial matching those that were not and vice versa simpler algorithms for bipartite matching such the fordfulkerson algorithm find one augmenting path per iteration the hopcroftkarp algorithm instead finds maximal set shortest augmenting paths ensure that only displaystyle osqrt iterations are needed instead displaystyle iterations the same performance displaystyle oesqrt can achieved find maximum cardinality matchings arbitrary graphs with the more complicated algorithm micali and vazirani the hopcroftkarp algorithm can seen special case dinics algorithm for the maximum flow problem augmenting paths vertex that not the endpoint edge some partial matching displaystyle called free vertex the basic concept that the algorithm relies that augmenting path path that starts free vertex ends free vertex and alternates between unmatched and matched edges within the path follows from this definition that except for the endpoints all other vertices any augmenting path must nonfree vertices augmenting path could consist only two vertices both free and single unmatched edge between them displaystyle matching and displaystyle augmenting path relative displaystyle then the symmetric difference the two sets edges displaystyle moplus would form matching with size 1 displaystyle thus finding augmenting paths algorithm may increase the size the matching conversely suppose that matching displaystyle not optimal and let displaystyle the symmetric difference displaystyle moplus where displaystyle optimal matching because displaystyle and displaystyle are both matchings every vertex has degree most 2 displaystyle displaystyle must form collection disjoint cycles paths with equal number matched and unmatched edges displaystyle augmenting paths for displaystyle and augmenting paths for displaystyle but the latter impossible because displaystyle optimal now the cycles and the paths with equal numbers matched and unmatched vertices not contribute the difference size between displaystyle and displaystyle this difference equal the number augmenting paths for displaystyle displaystyle thus whenever there exists matching displaystyle larger than the current matching displaystyle there must also exist augmenting path augmenting path can found algorithm may safely terminate since this case displaystyle must optimal augmenting path matching problem closely related the augmenting paths arising maximum flow problems paths along which one may increase the amount flow between the terminals the flow possible transform the bipartite matching problem into maximum flow instance such that the alternating paths the matching problem become augmenting paths the flow problem suffices insert two vertices source and sink and insert edges unit capacity from the source each vertex displaystyle and from each vertex displaystyle the sink and let edges from displaystyle displaystyle have unit capacity generalization the technique used hopcroftkarp algorithm find maximum flow arbitrary network known dinics algorithm algorithm the algorithm may expressed the following pseudocode input bipartite graph displaystyle gucup output matching displaystyle msubseteq displaystyle mleftarrow emptyset repeat 1 2 displaystyle mathcal pleftarrow ppdots maximal set vertexdisjoint shortest augmenting paths 1 2 displaystyle mleftarrow moplus pcup pcup dots cup until displaystyle mathcal pemptyset more detail let displaystyle and displaystyle the two sets the bipartition displaystyle and let the matching from displaystyle displaystyle any time represented the set displaystyle the algorithm run phases each phase consists the following steps breadthfirst search partitions the vertices the graph into layers the free vertices displaystyle are used the starting vertices this search and form the first layer the partitioning the first level the search there are only unmatched edges since the free vertices displaystyle are definition not adjacent any matched edges subsequent levels the search the traversed edges are required alternate between matched and unmatched that when searching for successors from vertex displaystyle only unmatched edges may traversed while from vertex displaystyle only matched edges may traversed the search terminates the first layer displaystyle where one more free vertices displaystyle are reached all free vertices displaystyle layer displaystyle are collected into set displaystyle that vertex displaystyle put into displaystyle and only ends shortest augmenting path the algorithm finds maximal set vertex disjoint augmenting paths length displaystyle maximal means that more such paths can added this different from finding the maximum number such paths which would harder fortunately sufficient here find maximal set paths this set may computed depth first search dfs from displaystyle the free vertices displaystyle using the breadth first layering guide the search the dfs only allowed follow edges that lead unused vertex the previous layer and paths the dfs tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges once augmenting path found that involves one the vertices displaystyle the dfs continued from the next starting vertex any vertex encountered during the dfs can immediately marked used since there path from displaystyle the current point the dfs then that vertex cant used reach displaystyle any other point the dfs this ensures displaystyle running time for the dfs also possible work the other direction from free vertices displaystyle those displaystyle which the variant used the pseudocode every one the paths found this way used enlarge displaystyle the algorithm terminates when more augmenting paths are found the breadth first search part one the phases analysis each phase consists single breadth first search and single depth first search thus single phase may implemented displaystyle timetherefore the first displaystyle sqrt phases graph with displaystyle vertices and displaystyle edges take time displaystyle oesqrt each phase increases the length the shortest augmenting path least one the phase finds maximal set augmenting paths the given length any remaining augmenting path must longer therefore once the initial displaystyle sqrt phases the algorithm are complete the shortest remaining augmenting path has least displaystyle sqrt edges however the symmetric difference the eventual optimal matching and the partial matching found the initial phases forms collection vertexdisjoint augmenting paths and alternating cycles each the paths this collection has length least displaystyle sqrt there can most displaystyle sqrt paths the collection and the size the optimal matching can differ from the size displaystyle most displaystyle sqrt edges since each phase the algorithm increases the size the matching least one there can most displaystyle sqrt additional phases before the algorithm terminates since the algorithm performs total most 2 displaystyle sqrt phases takes total time displaystyle oesqrt the worst case many instances however the time taken the algorithm may even faster than this worst case analysis indicates for instance the average case for sparse bipartite random graphs bast improving previous result motwani 1994 showed that with high probability all nonoptimal matchings have augmenting paths logarithmic length consequence for these graphs the hopcroftkarp algorithm takes log displaystyle olog phases and log displaystyle oelog total time comparison with other bipartite matching algorithms for sparse graphs the hopcroftkarp algorithm continues have the best known worstcase performance but for dense graphs 2 displaystyle eomega more recent algorithm alt achieves slightly better time bound log displaystyle oleftvsqrt frac elog vright their algorithm based using pushrelabel maximum flow algorithm and then when the matching created this algorithm becomes close optimum switching the hopcroftkarp method several authors have performed experimental comparisons bipartite matching algorithms their results general tend show that the hopcroftkarp method not good practice theory outperformed both simpler breadthfirst and depthfirst strategies for finding augmenting paths and pushrelabel techniques nonbipartite graphs the same idea finding maximal set shortest augmenting paths works also for finding maximum cardinality matchings nonbipartite graphs and for the same reasons the algorithms based this idea take displaystyle osqrt phases however for nonbipartite graphs the task finding the augmenting paths within each phase more difficult building the work several slower predecessors micali vazirani showed how implement phase linear time resulting nonbipartite matching algorithm with the same time bound the hopcroftkarp algorithm for bipartite graphs the micalivazirani technique complex and its authors did not provide full proofs their results subsequentlya clear exposition was published peterson loui and alternative methods were described other authors vazirani offered new simplified proof the micalivazirani algorithm pseudocode nil where and are the left and right sides the bipartite graph and nil special null vertex function bfs for each pairuu nil then distu enqueueq else distu distnil while emptyq false dequeueq distu distnil then for each adju distpairvv then distpairvv distu enqueueq pairvv return distnil function dfsu nil then for each adju distpairvv distu 1 then dfspairvv true then pairvv pairuu return true distu return false return true function hopcroftkarp for each pairuu nil for each pairvv nil matching 0 while bfs true for each pairuu nil then dfsu true then matching matching 1 return matching execution example graph showing input graph and matching after intermediate iteration 1 and final iteration explanation let the vertices our graph partitioned and and consider partial matching indicated the pairu and pairv tables that contain the one vertex which each vertex and matched nil for unmatched vertices the key idea add two dummy vertices each side the graph udummy connected all unmatched vertices and vdummy connected all unmatched vertices now run breadthfirst search bfs from udummy vdummy then can get the paths minimal length that connect currently unmatched vertices currently unmatched vertices note that the graph bipartite these paths always alternate between vertices and vertices and require our bfs that when going from always select matched edge reach unmatched vertex then end vdummy and the search for paths the bfs terminate summarize the bfs starts unmatched vertices goes all their neighbors all are matched then goes back the vertices which all these vertices are matched and which were not visited before then goes all the neighbors these vertices etc until one the vertices reached unmatched observe particular that bfs marks the unmatched nodes with distance then increments the distance every time comes back this guarantees that the paths considered the bfs are minimal length connect unmatched vertices unmatched vertices while always going back from edges that are currently part the matching particular the special nil vertex which corresponds vdummy then gets assigned finite distance the bfs function returns true iff some path has been found path has been found then there are augmenting paths left and the matching maximal bfs returns true then can ahead and update the pairing for vertices the minimallength paths found from using depthfirst search dfs note that each vertex such path except for the last one currently matched can explore with the dfs making sure that the paths that follow correspond the distances computed the bfs update along every such path removing from the matching all edges the path that are currently the matching and adding the matching all edges the path that are currently not the matching this augmenting path the first and last edges the path were not part the matching and the path alternated between matched and unmatched edges then this increases the number edges the matching this same replacing the current matching the symmetric difference between the current matching and the entire path note that the code ensures that all augmenting paths that consider are vertex disjoint indeed after doing the symmetric difference for path none its vertices could considered again the dfs just because the distpairvv will not equal distu 1 would exactly distu also observe that the dfs does not visit the same vertex multiple times this thanks the following lines distu return false when were not able find any shortest augmenting path from vertex then the dfs marks vertex setting distu infinity that these vertices are not visited again one last observation that actually dont need udummy its role simply put all unmatched vertices the queue when start the bfs for vdummy denoted nil the pseudocode above see also maximum

the guitar and drum tracks with new work downey and gorham gary moore had agreed participate well but ultimately did not 304 the song charted the 35 during early and 2 ireland and featured another greatest hits compilation album dedication the very best thin lizzy released february that year which reached 8 the album chart however followup reissue the boys are back town only reached 63 the although peaked 16 ireland following this numerous small reunion projects began appear lineup featuring robertson and downey performed with bobby tench lead vocals exgrand slam member doish nagle guitar and doug brockie bass they toured ireland briefly with series evening thin lizzy concerts 305 august downey bell robertson and wharton held tribute concert wolverhampton together with tribute bands limehouse lizzy aint lizzy and bad habitz another version thin lizzy was formed later that year john sykes now also performing lead vocals with downey gorham and wharton and with bass parts played marco mendoza who had played with sykes blue murder from 1991 the tour was advertised tribute phil lynott 214 this lineup also played the vibe for philo gig 4 january with number other notable musicians including eric bell midge ure henry rollins therapy and joe elliott and rick savage from def leppard collection thin lizzy tracks from the bbc radio 1 peel sessions was released and yet another compilation album was brought out called wild one the very best thin lizzy this was successful although did not feature the title track wild one 20 august rude awakening bassist robert ryder held celebration the life philip lynott the palace hollywood california the request lynotts mother philomena commemorate both phil lynotts birthday and the tenth year his passing philomena lynott her partner dennis keeley and smiley bolger irelands vibe for philo promoter were flown los angeles ryder make personal appearance the show featured concert performances rude awakening billy sheehan rudy sarzo john norum carmine appice phantom blue soma producer roy and his band the tribe gypsies mark ferrari oslo bang tango stash iron cross and irish singersongwriter mark dignam thin lizzy without lynott present john sykes era john sykes fronting the reformed version thin lizzy 2007 1996 john sykes decided reactivate thin lizzy presenting the band tribute phil lynotts life and work decided take the role lead vocals himself the absence lynott and persuaded scott gorham brian downey and darren wharton return the fold complete the lineup marco mendoza continued lynotts role bass player they received criticism for using the thin lizzy name without lynott being present 214 but the band only played hits from thin lizzys back catalogue and did not compose any new material tommy aldridge filled drums when brian downey was unable and became full member when downey left shortly thereafter this lineup remained stable through when the group recorded live album one night only the band went tour the playing clubs early but wharton had already left the band the time the tour from 2000 mendoza toured with ted nugent and with whitesnake sykes released two solo albums during while gorham worked with his band 21 guns thin lizzy performed sporadically during this period recruiting some musicians for single tours such bass guitarist guy pratt for the global chaos tour wharton later stated that thin lizzy would have been better suited playing fewer concerts bigger venues also felt that after the experience fronting his own band dare was not satisfying enough play keyboards behind gorham and sykes sykes said that all the previous thin lizzy members were welcome play with thin lizzy any time thin lizzy worked together again with sykes and gorham bringing angel bassist randy gregg and drummer michael lee who had played with robert plant and the cult among others they toured north america both the winter and then the summer special guests deep purple this lineup proved temporary however with mendoza returning and aldridge returning there were plans for new album though thin lizzy continued tour the london hammersmith apollo concert 13 december the lineup was sykes gorham aldridge and francesco dicosmo bass sykes stated that thin lizzy was now more tribute thing and that would wrong record new material under that name added that while the existing band members might record together would not thin lizzy gorham said that lynott still received the biggest cheer the night concerts and that the current thin lizzy was not active simply for money wed stop thought were just going through the motions think that has lot with the songs they were inferior then maybe would have got tired all but theyre not and havent said january gorham maintained that lynott would have approved the continuation the band worked long hours and travelled thousands miles get certain level theres way would have said noone should play those songs again thin lizzy along with support band the answer were support acdc stadium shows england ireland and scotland the end june but these appearances were cancelled after drummer aldridge broke his collarbone accident 30 june the bands website confirmed that sykes had left thin lizzy and all shows for the rest 2009 were cancelled postponed gorham stated that would announce thin lizzys future plans shortly statement said its been very tough time late for myself and the band firstly with drummer tommy aldridges injury and now the subsequent decision for john and the rest the group their separate ways can only apologise everyone who has supported over the years but will back full speed soon ricky warwick era and black star riders ricky warwick fronting thin lizzy download festival 2011 september gorham began assemble new version thin lizzy and may 2010 new lineup was announced joining gorham was original drummer brian downey longstanding keyboardist darren wharton def leppard guitarist vivian campbell and singer ricky warwick from the almighty while marco mendoza returned fill the bass guitar role exlizzy guitarist brian robertson was asked wanted participate but had previous commitments his own solo career addition full and european tour beginning january the band initially announced concert for 4 january the arena dublin which was conflict with the 2011 vibe for philo the tour itself started 6 january the music hall aberdeen the with the band finishing the tour the olympia dublin 17 february having cancelled the show april 2011 the band announced that vivian campbell would leaving thin lizzy amicably rejoin def leppard after one final gig 28 may was replaced guns roses guitarist richard fortus 28 august was announced that damon johnson alice cooper band would replacing fortus for thin lizzys tour the with judas priest fortus returned tour with guns roses for the rest the year and johnson has since replaced fortus permanently march gorham told billboardcom that thin lizzy may record new album the future saying thats the 1 question were getting from people are gonna record some new material the fans seem trust this lineup and dont blame them weve kind jumped this emotional hurdle together rickys writing some fucking killer lyrics and with the kind talent thats thin lizzy now think can pull off really cool set tunes least its something that can think about now where before wasnt the table 25 june thin lizzy were the studio recording new material although was not clear how many songs would recorded released 10 october thin lizzy announced that the new material would not released under the thin lizzy name but would released under different name due course according gorham this was out respect phil lynott and the legacy created though confirmed that the new material would feature the classic thin lizzy sound ricky warwick announced that the group would cease regular touring thin lizzy the end but that this did not necessarily mean they would never play thin lizzy again 20 december gorham revealed that the new material would recorded under the name black star riders and that downey and wharton had chosen not participate the new band project downey had decided take break from touring and wharton would working his own band dare and film project march the band toured australia under the thin lizzy name with downey and wharton the opening act triple bill with mtley cre and kiss gorham stressed that thin lizzy would still perform together occasionally well still out thin lizzy there are still certain big festivals that will thin lizzy still the horizon will still out and that but the meantime have black star riders that are going concentrate also 19 january the band revealed half dozen dates mid and early 2017 commemorate the anniversary the bands formation clarification needed and the anniversary lynotts death two festival dates were initially confirmed the ramblin man fair maidstone kent 23 july 2016 which midge ure once again joined them stage and the rock legends cruise fort lauderdale florida january the lineup for these shows was gorham warwick johnson and wharton with motrhead drummer mikkey dee initially confirmed standing for downey further dates were announced soon afterwards the monsters rock shows germany 17 and 18 june barcelona 17 july and the skogsrojet festival sweden 6 august 19 april was announced that dee would not participating after all and that judas priest drummer scott travis would taking downeys place for all shows except sweden 6 august when europe drummer ian haugland played also aerosmith bass guitarist tom hamilton was confirmed thin lizzys bassist for these shows after the shows were completed gorham confirmed that extended thin lizzy tours were probably thing the past but that the band would continue perform oneoff events stated kill off stone dead think would the wrong thing four further shows were announced for 2019 the spain and belgium troy sanders mastodon was recruited replace hamilton bass guitar for these shows september gorham left black star riders the band were planning very heavy touring schedule promote their upcoming fifth album warwick stated will looking put thin lizzy back out the road from 2022 onwards with busy schedule gorham made statement complimenting the band and thanking the fans and confirmed warwicks position thin lizzy adding regarding thin lizzy concerts 2022 this currently the planning stages and will make sure let you know our progress regarding lineups and dates other thin lizzy releases and tributes boxed set four cds thin lizzy material

that one may not view features hidden behind the model itself allowing only the naturally viewable portion the graphic visible background hiddensurface determination process which surfaces that should not visible the user for example because they lie behind opaque objects such walls are prevented from being rendered despite advances hardware capability there still need for advanced rendering algorithms the responsibility rendering engine allow for large world spaces and the worlds size approaches infinity the engine should not slow down but remain constant speed optimizing this process relies being able ensure the deployment few resources possible towards the rendering surfaces that will not end being displayed the user there are many techniques for hiddensurface determination they are fundamentally exercise sorting and usually vary the order which the sort performed and how the problem subdivided sorting large quantities graphics primitives usually done divide and conquer algorithms considering the rendering pipeline the projection the clipping and the rasterization steps are handled differently the following algorithms zbuffering during rasterization the depthz value each pixel sample the case antialiasing but without loss generality the term pixel used checked against existing depth value the current pixel behind the pixel the zbuffer the pixel rejected otherwise shaded and its depth value replaces the one the zbuffer zbuffering supports dynamic scenes easily and currently implemented efficiently graphics hardware this the current standard the cost using zbuffering that uses 4 bytes per pixel and that the rasterization algorithm needs check each rasterized sample against the zbuffer the zbuffer can also suffer from artifacts due precision errors also known zfighting coverage buffers cbuffer and surface buffer sbuffer faster than zbuffers and commonly used games the quake era instead storing the value per pixel they store list already displayed segments per line the screen new polygons are then cut against already displayed segments that would hide them sbuffer can display unsorted polygons while cbuffer requires polygons displayed from the nearest the furthest because the cbuffer technique does not require pixel drawn more than once the process slightly faster this was commonly used with binary space partitioning bsp trees which would provide sorting for the polygons sorted active edge list used quake this was storing list the edges already displayed polygons see scanline rendering polygons are displayed from the nearest the furthest new polygons are clipped against already displayed polygons edges creating new polygons display then storing the additional edges its much harder implement than sczbuffers but scales much better with increases resolution painters algorithm sorts polygons their barycenter and draws them back front this produces few artifacts when applied scenes with polygons similar size forming smooth meshes and backface culling turned the cost here the sorting step and the fact that visual artifacts can occur this algorithm broken design for general scenes cannot handle polygons various common configurations such surfaces that intersect each other binary space partitioning bsp divides scene along planes corresponding polygon boundaries the subdivision constructed such way provide unambiguous depth ordering from any point the scene when the bsp tree traversed the disadvantage here that the bsp tree created with expensive preprocess this means that less suitable for scenes consisting dynamic geometry the advantage that the data presorted and errorfree ready for the previously mentioned algorithms note that the bsp not solution hsr only aid ray tracing attempts model the path light rays viewpoint tracing rays from the viewpoint into the scene although not hiddensurface removal algorithm such implicitly solves the hiddensurface removal problem finding the nearest surface along each viewray effectively this equivalent sorting all the geometry perpixel basis the warnock algorithm divides the screen into smaller areas and sorts triangles within these there ambiguity polygons overlap indepth extent within these areas then further subdivision occurs the limit the subdivision may occur down the pixel level culling and visiblesurface determination related area visiblesurface determination vsd culling which usually happens before vsd rendering pipeline primitives batches primitives can rejected their entirety which usually reduces the load welldesigned system the advantage culling early the pipeline that entire objects that are invisible not have fetched transformed rasterized shaded here are some types culling algorithms viewingfrustum culling the viewing frustum geometric representation the volume visible the virtual camera naturally objects outside this volume will not visible the final image they are discarded often objects lie the boundary the viewing frustum these objects are cut into pieces along this boundary process called clipping and the pieces that lie outside the frustum are discarded there place draw them backface culling main article backface culling with objects some the objects surface facing the camera and the rest facing away from the camera the backside the object hindered the front side the object completely opaque those surfaces never need drawn they are determined the vertex winding order the triangle drawn has its vertices clockwise order the projection plane when facing the camera they switch into counterclockwise order when the surface turns away from the camera incidentally this also makes the objects completely transparent when the viewpoint camera located inside them because then all the surfaces the object are facing away from the camera and are culled the renderer prevent this the object must set doublesided backface culling done have separate inside surfaces contribution culling often objects are far away that they not contribute significantly the final image these objects are thrown away their screen projection too small see clipping plane occlusion culling see also zbuffering zculling objects that are entirely behind other opaque objects may culled this very popular mechanism speed the rendering large scenes that have moderate high depth complexity there are several types occlusion culling approaches potentially visible set pvs rendering divides scene into regions and precomputes visibility for them these visibility sets are then indexed runtime obtain highquality visibility sets accounting for complex occluder interactions quickly portal rendering divides scene into cellssectors rooms and portals doors and computes which sectors are visible clipping them against portals hansong zhangs dissertation effective occlusion culling for the interactive display arbitrary models describes occlusion culling approach divide and conquer popular theme the vsd literature divide and conquer the warnock algorithm pioneered dividing the screen beam tracing raytracing approach that divides the visible volumes into beams various screenspace subdivision approaches reducing the number primitives considered per region tiling screenspace bsp clipping tiling may used preprocess other techniques zbuffer hardware may typically include coarse hiz against

end syllable with saying huerva instead huelva people from working class areas seville can sometimes sound almost indistinguishable from puerto ricans zatu the singer the band sfdk from the pino montano district seville being example this distinction the main way distinguishing between the two accents when examples the transition zone exist nevertheless canarian spanish from spain canary islands made the major contribution puerto rican spanish and can considered the basis the dialect and accent many canarians came hopes establishing better life the americas most puerto rican immigration the early century included people from the canary islands who like puerto ricans had inherited most their linguistic traits from andalusia canarian influence most present the language those puerto ricans who live the central mountain region who blended with the remnant vocabulary the tano canarian and caribbean dialects share similar intonation which general terms means that stressed vowels are usually quite long puerto rican and canarian spanish accents are strikingly similar when visiting tenerife las palmas puerto ricans are usually taken first hearing for fellowcanarians from distant part the canary archipelago later the century other spanish immigrants from catalonia the balearic islands asturias and galicia plus other european settlersmostly from france including corsica italy ireland scotland germany and even some overseas chinese settled puerto rico words from these regions and countries joined the linguistic stew puerto rican typical word

puertorriqueo puerto rican tano borinqun tano influence when the spanish settlers colonized puerto rico the early century thousands tano people lived the island but almost immediately fell victim diseases brought from europe chicken pox measles smallpox influenza and the common cold which they had natural immunity this caused the rapid decline and almost complete destruction the indigenous tanos within the first fifty years exposure the european explorers and colonists great number tano language words like hamaca hammock hurakn hurricane and tabaco tobacco came into general spanish usage similar the employment indigenous words the north american mainland the englishspeaking colonists maize corn moccasin moccasin moose moose tano names andor hispanicized tano names for geographic locations such arecibo bayamn caguas canvanas guaynabo gurabo jayuya luquillo mayagez moca naguabo and vieques are found throughout puerto rico again similar the use native american words respect geographic locations the north american mainland alabama connecticut dakota idaho illinois kentucky michigan mississippi ohio oklahoma tennessee and utah african influence the first african slaves were brought the island the century although several african tribes have been recorded puerto rico the kongo from central africa that considered have had the most influence puerto rican spanish the early colonial period many african slaves puerto rico spoke bozal spanish words like gandul pigeon pea fuf mashed plantains and malanga root vegetable are commonly used and are african origin there also the afrocaribbeanwest indian influence for example many words and expressions come from patois and creolized languages from the neighboring islands united states influence and puerto rican anglicisms during the armed conflicts the puerto rican campaign spain ceded puerto rico the united states part peace treaty that brought the spanishamerican war sudden conclusion the united states army and the early colonial administration tried impose the english language island residents between 1902 and the main language instruction public schools used for all subjects except spanish language courses was english consequently many american english words are now found the puerto rican vocabulary english has had fluctuating status second official language the island depending the political party power the moment the majority puerto ricans today not speak english home and spanish remains the mother tongue puerto ricans stateside puerto ricans are known borrow english words phrases midsentence phenomenon called codeswitching sometimes characterized spanglish puerto rican writer giannina braschi published the first spanglish novel yoyo boing book that represents the codeswitching linguistic style some latino immigrants the united states however this mixture spanish and english simply informal blending languages not separate language dialect and not fundamental characteristic spanish puerto rican culture merely occasional convenience used speakers who are very fluent the two languages puerto rico has representation the royal spanish academy and has its own national academy along with the spanishspeaking countries hispanic america accent puerto rican accents both spanish and english could described reflection puerto rico historical ethnic cultures puerto rican spanish like the language every other spanishspeaking area has its distinctive phonological features accent which derive from the indigenous african and european languages that came into contact during the history the region the accents river plate spanish argentina and uruguay for example were heavily influenced the presence italians those countries the case puerto rico spaniards arrived from many regions within spain and brought with them their own regional dialectsaccents large number spaniards came particular from region southern spain andalusia and many others arrived from spains islands off the coast north africa known the canary islands when visiting tenerife las palmas islas canarias spain puerto ricans are usually taken first hearing for fellow canarians from distant part the canary archipelago the accents those regions that were the basis the accent spanish that spoken puerto rico the indigenous population tanos left many words the names geographical areas the island jayuya mayagez etc and others are used name everyday items such hamaca hammock describe natural phenomena such huracn hurricane africans puerto rico were brought slave labor mostly work coastal lowland sugar plantations they contributed large number words colloquialisms and island cuisine introduced words and influenced the speech rhythms that can noticed visiting the parts the island where they have historically been present almost exclusively along the coasts also the afrocaribbeanwest indian patoiscreole linguistic presence very strong and has influenced puerto rican culture reflected music such reggae and culinary dishes chinese puerto ricans and other asians who have established themselves puerto rico also adopt the accent but with tinge east asian the puerto rican accent somewhat similar the accents the spanishspeaking caribbean basin including cuba and the dominican republic and those from the caribbeancoastal regions venezuela colombia panama honduras and nicaragua particularly nonpuerto rican however any similarity will depend the level education the puerto rican speaker and their immediate geographic location also continues extremely similar the accent the canary islanders and andalusians southern spain overall most puerto ricans make emphatic distinction between their accent and other caribbean spanish accents features seseo parts spain considered proper spanish for the letter and the combos and pronounced similarly the english with the exceptions galicia andalusiaandaluca and the canary islands most spanishspeaking spain the pronunciation surnames ending the letter sound similar the english example lpez and hernndez are pronounced lpeth and hernndeth etc seseo seceo refers the pronunciation sound for the written solo letter and the letter when followed examples seceo zapato sapato not apato and azul asul not aul the seseoinfluenced spanish common throughout all latin america and the spanishspeaking caribbean aspiration elimination the syllablefinal position before consonant the end word debuccalized before voiced consonants eliminated altogether examples include rosah instead laz rosas las rosas the roses instead loz los dos the two this also common other lowland spanish areas caribbean basin river plate chile etc and the southern half spain the most common phrase this affects como ests and como est respectively these sound like comweta and comweta ootey see elimination the letter between vowels and the end words glottalisation usually realized muheeh instead laz muxees las mujeres the women and hose instead xose jos joseph elimination between vowels underoes lenition the point complete deletion ehtao instead estao estado state and too instead too all elimination the end word that case stress usually placed the final vowel examples include pae instead pae pared wall and mai instead mai madrid fricativization many rural puerto ricans not roll their tongues the double sound words arroz carro making sound like the scottish loch arroz and carro are pronounced aos and kao respectively however mostly free variant making aos and kao interchangeable aros and karo respectively lateralization the that the end syllable not followed vowel often changed that words like perdn forgiveness and puerto rico become peldn and puelto rico respectively realization syllable and wordfinal aside from and syllablefinal can realized influence american english puerto rican dialect verso verse becomes beso aside from beso berso belso invierno winter becomes imbjeno aside from imbjeno imbjerno imbjelno and parlamento parliament becomes palamento aside from palamento parlamento palamento wordfinal position will usually either trill tap approximant elided when followed consonant pause amo paterno paternal love amor amo tap approximant when the followed vowelinitial word amo eterno eternal love retraction wordfinal pronounced velar allophone before velar consonants and wordfinal position words include consideran knsie they consider and tehern tee tehran the best and most wellknown example this pattern can heard the puerto rican pronunciation for the widespread use the english word man which sound like meyng shortening words puerto ricans also often shorten words eliminating whole syllables examples are the words para madre and padre for mother and father puerto ricans may pronounce para madre mai and padre pai you will also hear the words comadre and compadre female and male friend respectively pronounced and spelled comay and compay another extremely commonly spoken sung and written expression for para meaning for you familiar intimate speech effects spanishenglish contact and bilingualism english class for spanish speakers juana diaz puerto rico march during the spanishamerican war and the early colonial period english was imposed island residents english currently official governmental language the island but rates bilingualism puerto rico with varying degrees proficiency english are modest given the sustained contact between spanish and english puerto rico and the mainland bilingual puerto ricans may exhibit contact phenomena codeswitching borrowing etc both their spanish and english puerto ricans descended from the large number migrants who left the island throughout the century can found numerous communities along the eastern coast the united states addition major metropolitan areas such new york many puerto ricans also went areas such connecticut chicago delaware new jersey florida massachusetts pennsylvania rhode island california and hawaii because

rhinoviruses are spread worldwide and are the primary cause the common cold symptoms include sore throat runny nose nasal congestion sneezing and cough sometimes accompanied muscle aches fatigue

that existed from 1979 its main purpose was demonstrate the value using modern techniques especially those involving formal methods software design and development three major projects dominated much the centres existence the first concerned the formal specification and compilation the chill programming language for use telecommunication switches the second involved the formal specification and compilation the ada programming language both the ada and chill efforts made use formal methods particular ddc worked with metaiv early version the specification language the vienna development method vdm formal method for the development computerbased systems founded dines bjrner this represented the danish school vdm this use vdm led 1984 the ddc ada compiler becoming the first european ada compiler validated the united states department defense the third major project was dedicated towards creation new formal method raise the success the ada compiler system would lead creation the commercial company ddc international ddci inc the which would develop productise and market both directly customers and other companies which would use the basis for their own ada compiler products origins ddcs origins were the technical university denmark spring christian gram computer scientist the technical university denmark dtulocated kongens lyngby north copenhagensuggested his colleague dines bjrner the idea building advanced software institute looking the software crisis the time they felt that computer science had created foundational and theoretical approaches that applied could make software development more professional process and permit the development large software systems schedule and with quality they approached the akademiet for tekniske videnskaber atv the danish academy for technical sciences with this idea and september dansk datamatik center was formed atv institute for advanced software development was also referred the danish datamatics centre some early documents ten large producers users information technology denmark became paying members the new entity christian rovsing crone koch the danish defence research establishment datacentralen 1959 jydsk

the managing director ddc was leif rystrm when reached its greatest size around some professional employees worked ddc with about 40 employees total ddc had budget dkk 13 million substantial increase from its initial budget dkk 1 million many the engineers hired came from dtu and copenhagen university the beginning the centre was housed building the dtu campus but then became located converted textile mill along the mlleen close lyngby centre the cubeinspired red logo ddc was designed ole friis who 1984 won the prize from the danish design centre for chill projects during bjrner became interested creating formal definition using denotational semantics the chill programming language then under development work the formal definition chill began that year based upon the request teleteknisk forskningslaboratorium assigned group under the comit consultatif international tlphonique tlgraphique ccitt and conducted dtu with some eighteen students working the effort once ddc was established the formal definition was completed there 1980 and opinions the value the effort differ bjrner has stated discovered definitional issue that led the simplification the language while remi bourgonjon philips the convener the implementors forum organized the ccitt thought the formal definition was too complicated and came too late benefit chill compiler designers the same time chill compiler was developed again starting before ddc but completed and tfl was developed using formal methods the two organisations made the compiler publicly available and would have important role education concerning the chill language was also adapted british firm imperial software technology with new code generator and found use gec and others during the joint project that gec and ddc carried out the early was investigate the incorporation chill into ada programming support environment apse support projects that used both languages ddcs part the project used examination the denotational semantics both languages and concluded that such integration was technically feasible ddc continued involved publishing papers chill conferences during the first half the but not after that ada projects ddc subsequently located itself the dansk gardin textil fabrik converted textile mill along the mlleen lyngby the advent the defense department sponsorship the ada programming language during the period led european interest the new language well and the commission the european communities cec decided allocate funding for european ada compiler and runtime system consortium olivetti from italy and ddc and christian rovsing from denmark submitted bid that early 1981 won out over previously favored bid from frenchgerman consortium half the funding would come from the cec and half from danish sources ole oest was transferred from the danish defence research establishment ddc manage the ada work ddc was responsible for developing portable ada programming system requirements included hosting the ada compiler small bit minicomputers such the christian rovsing crd and olivetti among other platforms and being able fit within 80 kilobytes code and 110 kilobytes data result the compiler was constructed many passes this case six for the front end alone with linearized trees stored files the representation between passes the compiler creation process went through four steps development formal specification ada development formal specification the compiler components development more detailed formal specifications particular compiler passes implementation these specifications ada itself among formal approaches using the vienna development method vdm was advantageous this project because was tailored for use with computer languages and compilers and because allowed stepwise refinement operations well data representations the central goal the process was prove that the implementation was equivalent the specification cases where the static abstract syntax representation needed have additional constraints incorporated wellformedness criteriaanother aspect vdmwere defined the first step the process formal specification for ada had already been started five students dtu 1980 part their masters theses ada was difficult language implement and early attempts build compiler for often resulted disappointment outright failure the ddc compiler was validated vaxvms system september being the first european ada compiler pass and proved success that point about 44 personyears development work had gone into the defect rate and maintenance costs would prove significantly lower for the compiler than for the software industry average attention regarding ddcs use vdm compiler design led interest from other computer manufacturers and sales were made what became known the ddc oem compiler kit the name being reference the original equipment manufacturer business model the compiler system offered two points for retargeting highlevel treestructured intermediate language and sequence instructions for abstract stack machine the latter meant shorter project times but usually not the most optimized generated code the abstract stackbased virtual machine was also worked christian rovsing there was also some idea possibly implementing hardware firmware the first such oem sale was nokia for rehosting the nokia mps the second with contract made february was with honeywell information systems boston the compiler was thus rehosted and retargeted the honeywell dps and validated november addition cross compilers began developed with ddc doing one from vaxvms the intel 8086 beginning what would become successful line products december ddc signed contract with advanced computer techniques new york based license royalty arrangement they began using the ddc front end develop crosscompiler for the milstda architecture which would become reasonably successful product with number customers success the ada project led separate company being formed called ddc international with the purpose commercializing the ada compiler system oest was named the managing director the company year later usbased subsidiary that company ddci inc was formed the state arizona concurrent with the compiler work there was push various fronts provide formal definition ada with several different approaches and metalanguages tried some europeans argued that such task was critical and that was the only basis upon which iso standard for the language should published the cec sponsored this work and the contract was won ddc partnership with two italian research institutes the istituto elaborazione dellinformazione iei pisa and the consorzio per ricerca applicazioni informatica crai genoa with work beginning additional consulting the project was provided staff the university genoa the university pisa and dtu the work built the previous formal definitions that had been done dtu and ddc the beginning its ada compiler project but further work was needed the define the entire language and metaiv had extended places alternate approaches taken this effort culminated the 1987 publication the full formal definition ada encompassing three separate publications and eight volumes total while this effort did lead better understanding the language and number clarifications being made the end the ultimate definition the language remained the natural language one the ada language reference manual raise projects the use vdm the chill and ada projects revealed the need for improvements formal specification techniques and 1983 ddc conducted formal methods appraisal study producing number requirements that formal specification language should embody following that ddc was awarded cec contract develop successor vdm which was called raise rigorous approach industrial software engineering this was done consortium with stc technology great britain which helped the creation the new technology and with nordisk brown boveri denmark and international computers limited britain which exercised industrial settings the project involved some 120 personyears effort and sought create widespectrum language intended handle every level from the initial highlevel abstract one down one level above programming sought remedy vdms weaknesses with respect modularity concurrency and lack tools and also sought unify approaches taken the likes notation csp larch and obj besides the raise specification language the project also produced description best practices for the raise method and raise toolset other projects 1981 ddc conjunction with some its members conducted study the many office automation initiatives and products then available and published taxonomy and terminology guide that analysed the domain they then specified generic office automation system using both vdm and informal language later during ddc worked subcontractor member data the functional analysis office requirements faor project under esprit ddc also gave courses and seminars various software development topics and starting initiated danishlanguage quarterly publication cubus which discussed various technical and scientific topics effort engage technology transfer conclusion and legacy during the centres existence some the constituent members lost interest its work with need for the chill ada compilers and the raise work too ambitious for their use general acceptance ada language underperformed expectations and ada product sales ddci did not provide sufficient profits allow money flow ddc with sustained funding becoming problem 1989 dansk datamatik center was closed down work the ada products was carried ddci where was used many highvisibility aerospace and similar projects the bestknown these was the airplane information management system flight software for the boeing 777 airliner subsequent developers the ddci ada compiler were often not well versed formal methods the original developers the ada products would still generating revenue for ddci into the ddcs work and staff raise were transferred computer resources international cri they used the basis for the european esprit lacos project the the raise effort was subsequently sold terma who use part work for the european space agency and various defense industry projects ddc had relatively little involvement with the nordic software world because relied european union based partners and funding and denmark was the only nordic country the the time nor did the danish financial sector ever show interest ddcs work looking back the founders the centre have stated that where ddc failed was convince major danish companies the benefits using reliable software development based formal methods but ddc did not try very much ddc researchers believed that their work was still beneficial making danish technology firms aware modern software development approaches and populating those firms with many hundred software designers and developers who had worked ddc and that any case ddc completed large number projects with better performance and higher product quality than was common the 2014 survey forty years formal methods efforts bjrner and klaus

abundance and seasonal distribution adult and larval mosquitoes and only then control strategy defined experimental biocontrol methods introducing large numbers sterile males another approach reducing mosquito numbers this called sterile insect technique sit radiation used disrupt dna the mosquitoes and randomly create mutations males with mutations that disrupt their fertility are selected and released mass into the wild population these sterile males mate with wild type females and offspring produced reducing the population size another control approach under investigation for aedes aegypti uses strain that genetically modified require the antibiotic tetracycline develop beyond the larval stage modified males develop normally nursery while they are supplied with this chemical and can released into the wild however their subsequent offspring will lack tetracycline the wild and never mature field trials were conducted the cayman islands malaysia and brazil control the mosquitoes

controlling mosquito populations the use ovitraps lethal ovitraps which provide artificial breeding spots for mosquitoes lay their eggs while ovitraps only trap eggs lethal ovitraps usually contain chemical inside the trap that used kill the adult mosquito andor the larvae the trap studies have shown that with enough these lethal ovitraps aedes mosquito populations can controlled recent approach the automatic lethal ovitrap which works like traditional ovitrap but automates all steps needed provide the breeding spots and destroy the developing larvae 2016 researchers from laurentian university released design for low cost trap called ovillanta which consists attractantlaced water section discarded rubber tire regular intervals the water run through filter remove any deposited eggs and larva the water which then contains oviposition pheromone deposited during egglaying reused attract more mosquitoes two studies have shown that this type trap can attract about seven times many mosquito eggs conventional ovitrap some newer mosquito traps known mosquito attractants emit plume carbon dioxide together with other mosquito attractants such sugary scents lactic acid octenol warmth water vapor and sounds mimicking mammals scent and outputs the trap draws female mosquitoes toward where they are typically sucked into net holder electric fan where they are collected according the american mosquito control association the trap will kill some mosquitoes but their effectiveness any particular case will depend number factors such the size and species the mosquito population and the type and location the breeding habitat they are useful specimen collection studies determine the types mosquitoes prevalent area but are typically far too inefficient useful

genes she says that the anopheles mosquitoes which spread malaria and aedes mosquitoes which spread dengue fever yellow fever elephantiasis zika and other diseases represent only 30 out some mosquito species eradicating these would save least one million human lives per year cost reducing the genetic diversity the family culicidae she further argues that since species become extinct all the time the disappearance few more will not destroy the ecosystem were not left with wasteland every time species vanishes removing one species sometimes causes shifts the populations other species but different need not mean worse addition antimalarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope the 300 million people developing nations who will infected with acute illnesses this year although trials are ongoing she writes that they fail should consider the ultimate swatting biologist wilson has advocated the extinction several species mosquito including malaria vector anopheles

similar betalh with the exception carboxy terminus peptide betactp containing four glycosylated serine residues that responsible for hcgs longer halflife function human chorionic gonadotropin interacts with the lhcg receptor the ovary and promotes the maintenance the corpus luteum for the maternal recognition pregnancy the beginning pregnancy this allows the corpus luteum secrete the hormone progesterone during the first trimester progesterone enriches the uterus with thick lining blood vessels and capillaries that can sustain the growing fetus has been hypothesized that hcg may

lowdose daily hcg injections combination with customized ultralowcalorie calday highprotein lowcarbohydratefat diet which was supposed result loss adipose tissue without loss lean tissue other researchers did not find the same results when attempting experiments confirm simeons conclusions and 1976 response complaints the fda required simeons and others include the following disclaimer all advertisements these weight reduction treatments include the injection hcg drug which has not been approved the food and drug administration safe and effective the treatment obesity weight control there substantial evidence that hcg increases weight loss beyond that resulting from caloric restriction that causes more attractive normal distribution fat that decreases the hunger and discomfort associated with calorierestrictive diets 1976 fdamandated disclaimer for hcg diet advertisements there was resurgence interest the hcg diet following promotion kevin trudeau who was banned from making hcg diet weightloss claims the federal trade commission and eventually jailed over such claims 1976 study the american journal clinical nutrition concluded that hcg not more effective weightloss aid than dietary restriction alone 1995 meta analysis found that studies supporting hcg for weight loss were poor methodological quality and concluded that there scientific evidence that hcg effective the treatment obesity does not bring about weightloss fatredistribution nor does reduce hunger induce feeling wellbeing november the american medical association ama passed policy that the use human chorionic gonadotropin hcg for weight loss inappropriate there scientific evidence that hcg effective the treatment obesity the metaanalysis found insufficient evidence supporting the claims that hcg effective altering fatdistribution hunger reduction inducing feeling wellbeing the authors stated the use hcg should regarded inappropriate therapy for weight reduction the authors opinion pharmacists and physicians should alert the use hcg for simeons therapy the results this metaanalysis support firm standpoint against this improper indication restraints physicians practicing this therapy can based our findings american society bariatric physicians commentary lijesen according the american society bariatric physicians new clinical trials have been published since the definitive 1995 metaanalysis the scientific consensus that any weight loss reported individuals hcg diet may attributed entirely the fact that such diets prescribe calorie intake between 500 and calories per day substantially below recommended levels for adult the point that this may risk health effects associated with malnutrition homeopathic hcg for weight control controversy about and shortages injected hcg for weight loss have led substantial internet promotion homeopathic hcg for weight control the ingredients these products are often obscure but prepared from true hcg via homeopathic dilution they contain either hcg all only trace amounts moreover highly unlikely that oral hcg bioavailable due the fact that digestive protease enzymes and hepatic metabolism renders peptidebased molecules such insulin and human growth hormone biologically inert hcg can likely only enter the bloodstream through injection the united states food and drug administration has stated that overthecounter products containing hcg are fraudulent and ineffective for weight loss they are also not protected homeopathic drugs and have been deemed illegal substances hcg classified prescription drug the united states and has not been approved for overthecounter sales the fda weight loss product for any other purposes and therefore neither hcg its pure form nor any preparations containing hcg may sold legally the country except prescription december fda and ftc started take actions pull unapproved hcg products from the market the aftermath some suppliers started switch hormonefree versions their weight loss products where the hormone replaced with unproven mixture free amino acids where radionics used transfer the energy the final product tetanus vaccine conspiracy theory catholic bishops kenya are among those who have spread conspiracy theory asserting that hcg forms part covert sterilization program forcing denials from the kenyan government order induce stronger immune response some versions human
